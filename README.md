## Inspiration

Our inspiration for the JobBridge project came from the mindset of "Shows up to a hackathon. Codes 0 lines of code. Leaves." We wanted to explore the possibilities of AI-generated code and understand the potential of such an approach in software development. This project aims to prove that an entire platform can be built with minimal human intervention by leveraging powerful AI models like OpenAI's GPT.

## What it does

JobBridge is an accessible job search platform designed to make the job hunting process easier and more inclusive for everyone, regardless of their abilities. The platform offers a comprehensive set of accessibility features to cater to diverse user needs. Users can search for jobs, filter them based on various parameters, and learn more about the roles and their accessibility provisions.

## How we built it

We used OpenAI's GPT technology for code generation, which allowed us to build the entire platform with minimal human coding. By providing GPT with context, desired outcomes, and specific requirements, we were able to generate code snippets, CSS styles, and even entire components for our application. As a result, we were able to focus on the overall project structure and functionality instead of writing lines of code.

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development process, we faced several challenges. One of the primary issues was making small changes to the generated code, as AI-generated code sometimes required more extensive modifications or workarounds. We addressed this by utilizing comments and suggestions from CoPilot to help us refine and regenerate code snippets as needed.

Another challenge was creating a database tailored to our specific needs. AI code generation for databases proved to be more difficult, as it required a deeper understanding of our platform's unique requirements and data structures.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the extensive accessibility features that JobBridge offers, such as:

- Browsing jobs based on disability access provisions
- Adjustable font sizes for visually impaired users
- Easy-to-change color palettes for users with color blindness
- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality
- Keyboard navigation support

These features showcase our commitment to creating an inclusive platform that caters to the needs of all users.

## What we learned

The JobBridge project taught us the importance of thinking about software development at a higher level of abstraction. By focusing on the overall structure and functionality of the application, rather than the specifics of the code itself, we were able to leverage AI-generated code to create a fully functional platform with minimal human intervention.

## What's next for JobBridge

There are several exciting directions for future development:

- Migrating job information to a suitable database for more robust data management
- Creating an employer-specific portal for companies to post job vacancies directly on the platform
- Implementing an easy-to-use filter system for users to find jobs based on their preferences and requirements

By continuing to enhance JobBridge's features and capabilities, we aim to create an even more powerful and accessible platform for job seekers everywhere.
